Build temperature, turbidity, conductivity sensor2.	Prepare wires/connectors3.	Prepare enclosure box and ‘brains’4.	Build depth gauge 5.	Build solar panel6.	Assemble all together7.	Calibrate sensors##Assemble Sensors1.	Put temperature, turbidity, conductivity sensors on protoboarda.	Solder things onto protoboardb.	Trim protoboard to fit in black sensor box###Temperature sensor1.	Solder the metal tabs (keep the side with 2 tabs separated by solder because they are electrically separated)###Conductivity sensor (part 1)1.	Solder in two leads for conductivity sensora.	One end goes into middle pin hole of temperature sensor (pin alone of the side), one end goes through hole two or three spots awayb.	Put resistor between second (white lead) to left one of the two pin side of the temperature sensor (left side is positive or VCC (power))i.	put through back of board, make bends in the wiresii.	solder wire to copper first, then make solder bridge to the white wire and second temperature piniii.	bend the wires outwards (allows us to connect other things to the conductor without having to use the same hole###Turbidity sensor1.	“stitch” in a second resistor – connect one end to the positive (VCC, left temperature probe pin) resistor end, bend the other end up the board and solder2.	“stitch” in a third resistor – connect one end to the positive (VCC) resistor end, bend the other end down the board and solder3.	Solder down the bent up/down ends and cut the extra wire past the solder blobs2.	Put the protoboard in the black sensor enclosure boxa.	Mark places to make holes for the LED and photoresistor (2 separate holes for an insulator between the 2 separate leads, so 4 holes total)b.	Mark the longer end of the LED with sharpie as the positive endc.	Put photoresistor and LED in holes so that they are facing each other with some space in between for water to flow throughd.	Solder the outside ends to the solder resistor blobs from beforee.	Trim soldered ends (1 LED, 1 photoresistor) and extra power VCC line – longer end of LED is the positive end, other end is ground; either end of photoresistor can be positive/negativef.	Attach the LED and photoresistor to ground (remaining white end/resistor)i.	To do this you might have to create a jumper (strip 2 ends of a short piece of new wire), attach to the black wire (1 prong of the temperature probe)ii.	Use jump to connect both LED and photoresistor to black wire blobiii.	Trim remaining LED, photoresistor leads###Make cable to go into black sensor boxa.	Need 5 wires because of 5 connection points, so need to take out a double length of cable and make a cable with 8 wires total b.	Twist 2 cable lengths together (ends up about 20 ft long) – use a drill to twist the two wires togetherc.	Cut off end of cable, strip all wires to reveal wiresd.	Orange wire = power (VCC, positive), blue = grounde.	Twist the two orange wires together and solder to the “power glob” where the 3 resistors are soldered togetherf.	Twist blue wires together and solder to ground (black wire with glob of ground)g.	White and blue wire for the conductivity sensor, solder to remaining resistor near white wireh.	White and orange wire for the turbidity sensor, solder to the photoresistor blobi.	Another wire to the remaining open prong on the temperature sensor for temperaturej.	Clip off the other end of the cable and strip to expose wiresk.	Put on the silver power connector – unscrew textured ring, remove screw, turn 1/8 of a turn and pull to expose back end of connectorl.	Pull wires through open connector end – twist together orange wires, blue wires (orange + orange, blue + blue)m.	Attach wires to pins on connector, use multimeter to figure out what each blue+white or orange+white wire is connected toi.	Pin 1 = ground (blue), pin 2 = power (orange), pin 3 = temperature sensor, pin 4 = conductivity sensor, pin 5 = turbidity sensor, pin 6 = not connected n.	Push all components together, backfill with hot glue and screw together###Finish Conductivity sensor a.	Stick pieces of pencil graphite into the ends of the black/white wire combo thing as far in as it goesb.	Drill two small holes near the wires, stick graphite through the holes, hot glue the shit out of it so the wires stay in place and water doesn’t get in##Enclosure/box for whole system (light grey box)a.	Need to put in three holes (1 size of 6 pin connector (silver), 1 size of 4 pin connector (silver), 1 size of 2 pin connector) on the side opposite of the sticker with about ¾ or 1 inch between holes##Brainsa.	Need 6 male to male, 4 male to male, 2 male to male cables for each connectorb.	Solder wires onto connecter pinsi.	Power connector (pin 1 = brown/ground, pin 2 = red/power)ii.	4 pin connector (depth gauge) (pin 1 = ground/black, pin 2 = power/red, pin 3 = signal/white, pin 4 = extra wire)iii.	6 pin connector (conductivity, temperature, turbidity sensors) (pin 1 = ground/green, pin 2 = power/orange, pin 3 = temperature/grey, pin 4 = conductivity/purple, pin 5 = turbidity/yellow, pin 6 = blue)##Solar panela.	Need about 4 ft of big cable, strip about 1 in on one end for the panel connection, about ½ in on other end for connectorb.	For panel connectioni.	Twist together blue and blue+white wires = ground/negativeii.	Twist together orange and orange+white wires = power/positivec.	For power connector connectioni.	Pin 1 = blue/groundii.	Pin 2 = orange/powerd.	Close plug together except for end bit, backfill with hot gluee.	Hot glue over solar panel connection##Mounting things in the large enclosure boxa.	Cut out a flat/hard base to mount things in the box (about 12cm x 12cm)b.	Put solar board + wild fire on mount board, screw in c.	Take off solar board, connect to the voltage booster with 0.1 in head pinsi.	Put tiny plug in + - under LOAD, solder in place on undersideii.	Cut off 2 of the head pins, plug in 2 holes near battery above LiPower, plug this into plug on power boardiii.	Make output from voltage booster into inputs for wild fire + - pins (black/ground, white/VCC)iv.	Need a way for power into the board1.	Cut a 2 pin wide connector by going to 3rd pin and cutting2.	Spread the 2 terminals a bit to accommodate other connections3.	Then the + - from solar panel can get plugged inv.	Connect solar panel to wild fire in VIN (+) and ground plugsvi.	Reinstall solar panel on mounting board##Depth sensora.	Solder big cable (about 20 ft or as long as the previous cable length) to the depth sensori.	Strip about 1 in off, solder the 2 mostly white wires together for signal, blue = ground, orange = powerb.	Put depth sensor on its side, the pins in the white box are signal = left most, blue = middle, orange/power = rightc.	Remove/destroy white cover thing OR unsolder the connector pins so the cable wires can be directly attached to the probed.	Hot glue the wires to hold them to the yellow thinge.	Make a slit in the top of the PCV pipe by drilling two holes awayf.	Glue depth gauge across the opening so the cable goes through slitg.	Hot glue around the top of pipe and put on PVC caph.	Strip other end of the long cable wires and connect to the silver connector i.	Pin 1 = ground/blue, pin 2 = power/orange, pins 3 and 4 are interchangeable white wiresi.	Backfill with hot glue, put silver part back on very quickly and tighten screws##Connect everything togethera.	Connect the boost board to the solar boardb.	Plug power into power input (red = positive, brown = negative)c.	Power booster white/black to big board (white wire to VIN)d.	Depth gauge (4 pin connector)i.	Signal = white wire to a0 (analog 0 input)ii.	Ground = black wire to ground inputiii.	Power = red wire to 5Viv.	Brown wire = disconnectede.	Temperature, conductivity, turbidity (6 pin connector)i.	Green wire = ground ii.	Orange wire = power (3V3 pin)iii.	Grey wire = a1iv.	Purple = a2v.	Yellow = a3vi.	Blue = disconnectedf.	Connect battery into batter jack on solar panelg.	Plug in supply, sensor box, depth sensor##General notesFor attaching wires to pins, usually pin 1 = ground, pin 2 = power, pin 3 = signal
