#Calibration Protocols for the Cornell Integrated Sensing Station v1 (CISSv1)

*Pete Marchetto, Postdoctoral Research Associate, Cornell Soil and Water Lab*

##Introduction
The CISSv1 is the first version of a massively deployable integrated sensing system for stream gauging. This document is a collection of five protocols to characterize and calibrate its sensors and main microcontroller board. All of these protocols should be carried out at the very least at both room temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures that the Device Under Test (DUT) will experience in use.

The processes described in these protocols are not calibrations in and of themselves, but are actually characterizations of the sensors and sensing system. The calibration is done in post-processing, where the digital output values of the CISS will be put into the transfer functions described by these tests.

Most importantly, these protocols are scientific experiments: the hypothesis is that the DUT will function as a conglomeration of linear sensors with definable transfer functions. By doing this experiment, one can to expect to either support that hypothesis and gather data that will allow for proper mapping of the sensitivity of the DUT in each of its modalities, or to refute the hypothesis, and find that the system must be repaired.

###DUT Preparation
In order to prepare the DUT for testing, serial output code should be loaded onto it, and it should be kept connected to a test system computer for the duration of all tests. This can be done by connecting the WildFire board to a computer via a USB A-to-microB cable, and loading the [AnalogRead](https://codebender.cc/sketch:143324) sketch onto it.

##Depth Sensor Characterization
###Theory of Operation
In this characterization, the output of the depth sensor will be characterized as a function of the height at which its float sits. The depth sensor is a [Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Infrared/gp2y0a02yk_e.pdf) in the top of a PVC pipe, and is capable of measuring a range of 20 to 150 cm from the sensor head. The sensor works by bouncing IR light off of the float (usually a ping-pong ball) and reading out a voltage inversely proportional to the distance from the sensor lens to the float.

###Equipment Needed

- Laptop
- Surface Plate
- Height Gauge

###Pre-cal Procedure

2. Place the 1/4" Neodymium magnet in its holder on the measuring arm of the height gauge
3. Zero the height gauge by placing its measuring arm gently on the surface plate and pressing the zero button
4. Place the 4" gauge block between the surface plate and the underside of the measuring arm and record the reading on the height gauge (in mm)
5. Place the 2" gauge block on top of the 4" gauge block and repeat the measurement
6. Place the 1" gauge block on top of the other two and repeat the measurement

3. Attach DMM to the signal and ground pins
2. Clean the end of the depth sensor pipe
3. Insert the ping-pong ball with the neodymium magnet in it into the open end of the depth sensor pipe
4. Place the depth sensor pipe, opening down, onto the surface plate
5. Bring the height gauge alongside the pipe, and lower the measuring arm until the magnet on it attracts the one inside the sensor
6. Move the measuring arm up until the height gauge reads 100 mm, then lock the height gauge in place
7. Record the number being output from the serial terminal and the number on the DMM
8. Move the measuring arm up until the height gauge reads 200 mm, then lock the height gauge in place
9. Record the number being output from the serial terminal and the number on the DMM

11. Record the number being output from the serial terminal and the number on the DMM
12. Move the measuring arm up until the height gauge reads 550 mm, then lock the height gauge in place
13. Record the number being output from the serial terminal and the number on the DMM
15. Move the measuring arm up until the height gauge reads 400 mm, then lock the height gauge in place
16. Record the number being output from the serial terminal and the number on the DMM
17. Move the measuring arm up until the height gauge reads 200 mm, then lock the height gauge in place
18. Record the number being output from the serial terminal and the number on the DMM

20. Record the number being output from the serial terminal and the number on the DMM
21. Remove the ping-pong ball from the pipe
21. Gently remove the height gauge and put it away
22. Disconnect the DMM

###Calibration
1. Enter the data into a spreadsheet in the form: 100,1000,2.41 etc., with the height as the independent variable and the outputs as the dependent variables (first LSB, then V)
2. Find a linear regression that fits the values; make particular note of any hysteresis, as this will be directly proportional to the uncertainty of the sensor
3. Record the equations of the functions that fit, along with their R^2 values
4. Calculate the inverse functions, so LSB and V can be transformed to m

##Temperature
###Theory of Operation
The temperature characterization takes advantage of the thermodynamic stability of phase changes. By having a number of different compounds with different transition points in the same container in roughly the same volumes, multiple transition points can be reached and equilibriated at, thus making it possible to create stable thermal plateaus. This is all done as a transfer calibration with a calibrated thermometer.
