Welcome! We hope that you'll join us in building your own stream gauging station using the directions on these pages. If you're looking for the build instructions, you can find them in the [BUILD](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab/StreamGauge/blob/master/BUILD.md) page. If you're done with building, you'll want to [UPLOAD](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab/StreamGauge/blob/master/UPLOAD.md) your code to the unit. Finally, once you're done with that, you should [CAL](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab/StreamGauge/blob/master/CAL.md) your unit before deployment.

Good luck, and let us know if you have any questions by e-mailing [pmm223@cornell.edu](mailto:pmm223@cornell.edu).
